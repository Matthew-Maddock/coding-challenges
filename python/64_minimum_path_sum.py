# 64. Minimum Path Sum - Medium

# Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right, which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

# Note: You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

# Example 1:

# Input: grid = [[1,3,1],[1,5,1],[4,2,1]]
# Output: 7
# Explanation: Because the path 1 → 3 → 1 → 1 → 1 minimizes the sum.\

            grid[i][0] += grid[i - 1][0]
        for j in range(1, n):
            grid[0][j] += grid[0][j - 1]
        for i in range(1, m):
            for j in range(1, n):
                grid[i][j] += min(grid[i - 1][j], grid[i][j - 1])
        return grid[m - 1][n - 1]
