# 137. Single Number II - Medium

# Given an integer array nums where every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find the single element and return it.

# You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [2,2,3,2]
# Output: 3
from typing import List


class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:

        for num in nums:
            ones ^= num & ~twos

        return ones
