# 28. Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String - Medium

# Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.


# Example 1:

# Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
# Output: 0
# Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.
# The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.


class Solution:
    def strStr(self, haystack: str, needle: str) -> int:
        m = len(haystack)
        n = len(needle)

        for i in range(m - n + 1):
            if haystack[i : i + n] == needle:
                return i

        return -1
