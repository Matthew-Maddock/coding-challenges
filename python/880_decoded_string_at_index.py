# 880. Decoded String at Index - Medium

# You are given an encoded string s. To decode the string to a tape, the encoded string is read one character at a time and the following steps are taken:

# If the character read is a letter, that letter is written onto the tape.
# If the character read is a digit d, the entire current tape is repeatedly written d - 1 more times in total.
# Given an integer k, return the kth letter (1-indexed) in the decoded string.

# Example 1:


# Input: s = "leet2code3", k = 10
# Output: "o"
# Explanation: The decoded string is "leetleetcodeleetleetcodeleetleetcode".
# The 10th letter in the string is "o".
class Solution:
    def decodeAtIndex(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
        size = 0

        for c in s:

                size *= int(c)
            else:
                size += 1

        for c in reversed(s):
            k %= size
            if k == 0 and c.isalpha():
                return c
            if c.isdigit():
                size //= int(c)
            else:
                size -= 1
