# 86. Partition List - Medium

# Given the head of a linked list and a value x, partition it such that all nodes less than x come before nodes greater than or equal to x.

# You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.

# Example 1:


# Input: head = [1,4,3,2,5,2], x = 3
# Output: [1,2,2,4,3,5]
