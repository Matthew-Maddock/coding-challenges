# 958. Check Completeness of a Binary Tree - Medium

# Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a complete binary tree.

# In a complete binary tree, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible.
# It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.
